<h1>How people and organizations can help</h1>
 
<p class="margin-top-10">In addition to attending the events, we encourage local organizations and employers to recognize the women who’ve been trailblazers in their own histories by posting tributes on their web sites and newsletters. Local families and individuals can research the lives and achievements of women in their own families, and share their stories on Facebook. The goal is to tell the untold story of women’s lives and contributions in our community’s history.</p>

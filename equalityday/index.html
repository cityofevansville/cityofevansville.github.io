    <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>he Women’s Equality Day Centennial Celebration Committee is pleased to announce the 19th Amendment Centennial Suffrage Celebration. For the past 18 years, Evansville has recognized and celebrated the adoption of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. The passage of the 19th Amendment marked one of the largest expansions of democracy in the history of our country. This historic centennial offers an unparalleled opportunity to commemorate a milestone of democracy and to explore its relevance to the issues of equal rights today. The Women’s equality Day Committee has been busy planning a series of events for 2020, leading up to the Women’s Equality Day Centennial Celebration Luncheon on August 26, 2020. The Centennial Celebration Luncheon promises to be a historic event for the Evansville community and we are asking for your involvement and support.</p>

    <p class="margin-top-10">This year's keynote speaker will be Dr. Mae C. Jemison, the first woman of color to walk in space. Dr. Jemison broke more than the sound barrier in 1992 when she climbed aboard the space shuttle Endeavour and became the first woman of color to travel into space. She was also NASA’s first Science Mission Specialist performing experiments in material science, life science and human adaptation to weightlessness. Dr. Jemison is a physician, engineer and a highly sought after speaker on issues of health care, social responsibility, technology, education, STEM, and motivation. We believe Dr. Jemison’s message is particularly important as Evansville-area employers face continuing challenges to attract and retain a skilled 21st century workforce. We also want to extend her message to our schools and universities and their students. The goal is to begin a dialogue that could lead to significant opportunities for our youth, employers and our entire community.</p>

<h1>How people and organizations can help</h1>

Local families and individuals can research the lives and achievements of women in their own families, and share their stories on Facebook. The goal is to tell the untold story of women’s lives and contributions in our community’s history.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character ny">B</span>reaking into the New York fashion world is no easy task. But by the early 2000's, UGG Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of UGG from a brand that made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and sandals for an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that was now being touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious lifestyle was swift. Much of this was due to a brand repositioning effort that transformed UGG into a high-end luxury footwear maker. As a fashion brand, UGG advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue Magazine as well as other fashion books. In the mid 2000's, the desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all over the world and UGG was now perfectly aligned with this movement.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and slippers on their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion was carved out. As a result, the desire and love for UGG increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG experience. UGG began offering numerous color and style variations on their sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots for women and men and leather casuals were added with great success. What started as a niche item, UGG sheepskin boots were now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections followed, showcasing everything from knit boots to sneakers to wedges, all the while maintaining that luxurious feel UGG is known for all over the world. UGG products were now seen on runways and in fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long, the love spread even further.</p>

The widespread love for UGG extended to Europe in the mid-2000's along with the stylish casual movement and demand for premium casual fashion. UGG boots and shoes were now seen walking the streets of London, Paris and Amsterdam with regularity. To meet the rising demand from new fans, UGG opened flagship stores in the UK and an additional location in Moscow. As the love spread farther East, concept stores were opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. UGG Australia is now an international brand that is loved by all. This love is a result of a magical combination of the amazing functional benefits of sheepskin and the heightened emotional feeling you get when you slip them on your feet. In short, you just feel better all over when you wear UGG boots, slippers, and shoes.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>

Partnering with Super Bowl champion and NFL MVP Tom Brady, UGG will invite even more men to feel the love the rest of the world knows so well. UGG will also step into the world of high fashion with UGG Collection.

    <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>he Women’s Equality Day Centennial Celebration Committee is pleased to announce the 19th Amendment Centennial Suffrage Celebration. For the past 18 years, Evansville has recognized and celebrated the adoption of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. The passage of the 19th Amendment marked one of the largest expansions of democracy in the history of our country. This historic centennial offers an unparalleled opportunity to commemorate a milestone of democracy and to explore its relevance to the issues of equal rights today. The Women’s equality Day Committee has been busy planning a series of events for 2020, leading up to the Women’s Equality Day Centennial Celebration Luncheon on August 26, 2020. The Centennial Celebration Luncheon promises to be a historic event for the Evansville community and we are asking for your involvement and support.</p>

    <p class="margin-top-10">This year's keynote speaker will be Dr. Mae C. Jemison, the first woman of color to walk in space. Dr. Jemison broke more than the sound barrier in 1992 when she climbed aboard the space shuttle Endeavour and became the first woman of color to travel into space. She was also NASA’s first Science Mission Specialist performing experiments in material science, life science and human adaptation to weightlessness. Dr. Jemison is a physician, engineer and a highly sought after speaker on issues of health care, social responsibility, technology, education, STEM, and motivation. We believe Dr. Jemison’s message is particularly important as Evansville-area employers face continuing challenges to attract and retain a skilled 21st century workforce. We also want to extend her message to our schools and universities and their students. The goal is to begin a dialogue that could lead to significant opportunities for our youth, employers and our entire community.</p>

<h1>How people and organizations can help</h1>
 
<p class="margin-top-10">In addition to attending the events, we encourage local organizations and employers to recognize the women who’ve been trailblazers in their own histories by posting tributes on their web sites and newsletters. Local families and individuals can research the lives and achievements of women in their own families, and share their stories on Facebook. The goal is to tell the untold story of women’s lives and contributions in our community’s history.</p>
